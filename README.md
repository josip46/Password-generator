# Password-generator
Password generator that creates a password for you, that you can save into a text file. 

I created this project while going through udemy '100 Days of Code' tutorials. 

How to use it:
It can generate random password for you with 'Generate Password' button. When password is generated it is copied to clipboard so you can use it immediately. After you are done inserting all the required info you can save your password and email for certain website into the text file 'Data.txt' by pressing button 'add' and confirming your information.
